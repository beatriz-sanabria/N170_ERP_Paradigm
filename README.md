# N170_ERP_Paradigm

This project is a proposal of a paradigm to evaluate the N170 ERP.

This project aimed to propose and design a new paradigm to evaluate 
the N170 without any trigger module, only with the amplifier, in this 
case, the Synamps RT of Neuroscan.

The paradigm consisted in show 360 visual stimuli, 300 corresponded 
to images of faces with the four basic emotions: joy, sadness, anger, 
and fear, and a neutral expression. The other 60 stimuli were images 
of three different objects: a ball, a butterfly, and an airplane. 
All these images were shown for 850 ms and between them, an image 
of a fixation cross was placed with a variable duration of 500 to 
1600 ms. The paradigm lasted 14 minutes approximately. The objects 
were showed to keep the attention of the children in the paradigm. 
Otherwise, the fixation cross was used to avoid that the brain 
habituated to the visual stimuli. 

The code expects as input the images mentioned and as output an excel file was created. This file contained 
the date and the hour when each stimulus showed up. This data allowed 
us to know how many milliseconds were between stimuli to put then the 
marks in the EEG recording. The following images are examples of the Matlab GUI.

*** The purpose of this repository is to show the main file and 
    the results we obtained after running it. All the codes were 
    programmed in Matlab.
    
    Due to the code license, we did not make a continuous versioning 
    in the repository
